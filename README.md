## Hold the Door Challenge - Cheat Online Voting Contests :door:

This repoistory contains Python scripts written for a web scraping challenge
project completed as part of the Year 1 curriculum at Holberton School. In this
project, I used Python's `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pytesseract` packages
to simulate votes for a series of increasingly complicated voting contest
websites.

For each level, I was challenged with writing a script to submit a certain number
of votes to a PHP form. The levels and their corresponding scripts are listed below:

* **Level 0**
  * [level_0/1024.py](./level_0/1024.py): Votes with my Holberton ID 1024 times
[here](http://158.69.76.135/level0.php).

* **Level 1**
  * [level_1/4096.py](./level_1/4096.py): Votes with my Holberton ID 4096 times
[here](http://158.69.76.135/level0.php).

* **Level 2**
  * [level_2/1024.py](./level_2/1024.py): Votes with my Holberton ID 1024 times
[here](http://158.69.76.135/level2.php).

* **Level 3**
  * [level_3/1024.py](./level_3/1024.py): Votes with my Holberton ID 1024 times
[here](http://158.69.76.135/level3.php).

* **Level 4**
  * [level_4/98.py](./level_4/98.py): Votes with my Holberton ID 98 times
[here](http://158.69.76.135/level4.php).
