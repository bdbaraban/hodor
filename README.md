## Hold the Door Challenge - Cheat Online Voting Contests

This repoistory contains Python scripts written for a web scraping challenge 
project completed as part of the Year 1 curriculum at Holberton School. In this 
project, I used Python's `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pytesseract` packages 
to simulate votes for a series of increasingly complicated `.php` voting contest 
websites.

For each level, I was challenged with writing a script to submit a certain number 
of votes. The levels and their corresponding scripts are listed below:

* **Level 0**
  * `level_0/1024.py`: Votes with my Holberton ID 1024 times [here](http://158.69.76.135/level0.php).
* **Level 1**
  * `level_1/4096.py`: Votes with my Holberton ID 4096 times [here](http://158.69.76.135/level0.php).
* **Level 2**
  * `level_2/1024.py`: Votes with my Holberton ID 1024 times [here](http://158.69.76.135/level2.php).
* **Level 3**
  * `level_3/1024.py`: Votes with my Holberton ID 1024 times [here](http://158.69.76.135/level3.php).
